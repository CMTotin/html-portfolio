<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Chris. I have a Computer Science BS degree that I earned at 
  the end of 2012 from Pennsylvania State University in University Park, PA. 
  However, I was not able to break into the tech industry after graduating 
  and ended up in customer service and sales roles. Recently I have found 
  renewed interest in coding and the IT field. This website, along with others 
  I plan to create in the future is the start of my attempt at finally breaking 
  into the industry. My goal is to enter the field as a website developer. 
  I have spent time studying online the past month to brush up on what I already 
  know from school and to add new programming languages and technologies to my 
  arsenal with a major focus on website developement. I plan to build this website 
  as I learn and grow, and over time I hope to build something special that I can 
  show employers to aquire and entry-level or junior level position.</p>
